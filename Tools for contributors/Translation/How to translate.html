<H1>Translation tool help</H1>
<p>
	This documentation is designed for those who want to add translations of AHF.
</p>
<p>
	You need some tools in some steps. You'll find them here:
	<ul>
		<li/><b>Translation tool</b>: language\Translation Tool.ahk
		<li/><b>Find modules</b>: find modules.ahk
	</ul>
</p>

<H2>How to start</H2>
<p>This section describes how you can create new elements with minimum effort.</p>
<p><ul>
	<li/>Open the <b>Translation tool</b>
	<li/>Select the workspace. There are translation files for AHF itself and for each package. AHF comes with the "Default" package.
	<li/>If you want to add a new language
	<ul>
		<li/>Click on "Add new language"
		<li/>Fill out the form and click on OK
	</ul>
	<li/>Select an entry in the tree view (on left side) and the language in the list view (on right side)
	<li/>Enter the translated string. The tool saves the changes instantly. You don't need to think about saving at all.
	<li/>Proceed with all other entries.
	<li/>Each element has a help files. You'll find them in <b>Source_Elements\Default\help</b>.
	<li/>Copy the help files to a folder that matches the ID of your language, open the html files and translate them.
	<li/>Run the tool <b>Find modules</b>. This will make your changes visible to AHF.
	<li/>Reload AHF and check the result.
	<li/>Send the all translated files via email to <a href= "mailto:autohotflow@arcor.de">autohotflow@arcor.de</a></b>. I'll include it in the next update of AHF.
	<li/>Please update your translations regularely. If AHF gets some updates and the translations won't get any update, I'll remove it if the amount of untranslated strings gets too big.
</ul></p>

<H2>Remarks</H2>
<p>You can highlight untranslated entries: Select the language in the dropdown and click on "Find untranslated entries". Now all untranslated entries will be highlighted.</p>
<p>You can highlight entries with specified string: Select the language in the dropdown, write search text in the edit field and click on "Search". Now all entries with that string will be highlighted.</p>
