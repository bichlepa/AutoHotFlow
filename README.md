This script is designed to make programming and automation easy as never before! Just pull in some elements in the graphical interface and set up some triggers. Ready! :smile:


This project ist made for people who never have programmed before and for those who want to make some automation, etc. without writing long codes.
It's very easy to use. You need to pull an action or a condition, configurate them and connect them.
You can optionally add some triggers, that will trigger the flow in certain cases.
When the flow executes the currently running elements are highlighted red.

Every element has settings
 ![Element Tooltip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fzj75txfnlj1bzn/Element%20Tooltip.png?dl=1)

There is also flow manager
 ![Manager](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szgtxzcl0u31uka/Manager.png?dl=1)

It has all basic functions. I'm working on it and its abilities are raising.
My aim is to include many elements that would need many lines of ahk-code and thus to allow programming some complex things easier.
It could also demontrate the broad possibilities of AutoHotkey.

I'd appreciate if you will use it, test it, help me programming and /or comment this project :wave:
