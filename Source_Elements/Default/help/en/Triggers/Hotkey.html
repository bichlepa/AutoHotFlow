			<h4>Hotkey</h4>
			<p>Specify one or more keys that should be pressed in order to trigger the flow.
				<br/>The left field contains the hotkey definition. The right field can be used for quickly retrieving the hotkey definition by pressing the keys (it doesn't work with all key combinations).
				<br/>A hotkey is defined by its name and optionally some modifiers.
				<br/>Read more about hotkey definitions in the remarks.

	<TR>
		<TD>
			<h4>Options</h4>
			<p>If <b>Block key</b> is checked, the hotkey will not pass though to the active window. For example if the hotkey is <code>space</code>, it will not be possible to enter a space anywhere.
				<br/>If <b>Trigger even if other keys are held down</b> is checked, the specified hotkey will fire even if extra modifiers are being held down. For example if the hotkey is <code>s</code>, it will also trigger if the user presses the key combination "Control + s".
				<br/>If <b>Trigger on release rather than on press</b> is checked, the specified hotkey will trigger when user releases the hotkey. It will not trigger when the hotkey is pressed and held down.
			</p>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
			<h4>Scope</h4>
			<p>If <b>Everywhere</b> is selected, the hotkey will always trigger, regardless on the currently active window.
				<br/>If one of the other options is selected, the hotkey will only be active when a specific window is active or exists, or otherwise.
			</p>

			<h4>Window identification</h4>
			<p><b>Title of window</b>: Name of the window title. It can be chosen whether the title starts, contains or ends with the specified string.
				<br/><b>Exclude title</b>: Windows whose titles include this value will not be considered.
				<br/><b>Text of a control in window</b>: If present, this parameter must be a substring from a single text element of the target window. It can be specified whether hidden text will be found
				<br/><b>Exclude text of a control in window</b>: Windows whose text include this value will not be considered
				<br/><b>Window class</b>: A window class is a set of attributes that the system uses as a template to create a window. In other words, the class name of the window identifies what type of window it is.
				<br/><b>Process name</b>: The name or path of the executable that created that window.
				<br/><b>Unique window ID</b>: Each window or control has a unique ID, also known as a HWND (short for handle to window). This ID can be used to identify the window or control even if its title changes.
				<br/><b>Unique process ID</b>: Use the unique process id to identify a window belonging to a specific process. Each process has its unique ID, even if it has the same executable.
				<br/><b>Hidden window</b>: If detect hidden window is selected, a window that exists but is not visible will be found.
				<br/><b>Import window identification</b>: Use a wizard to get parameters of a window.
			</p>
			<p>At least <b>Title of window</b>, <b>Window class</b>, <b>Process name</b>, <b>Unique window ID</b> or <b>Unique process ID</b> must be set.</p>

			<p>Win (Windows logo key). For Windows Vista and later, hotkeys that include the Windows key (e.g. <code>#a</code>) will wait for the Windows key to be released before sending any text containing an "L" keystroke. This prevents usages of action <b>Send Keystrokes</b> within such a hotkey from locking the PC. This behavior applies to all sending modes except SendPlay (which doesn't need it).</p>
